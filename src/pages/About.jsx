        <p>
          <strong>Historical Placemarks</strong> is a web application designed to help history enthusiasts,
          students, and researchers document and explore Ireland's rich historical heritage.
        </p>

        <p>
          Users can create placemarks for historical sites such as castles, monasteries, forts, and ancient
          monuments. Each placemark includes geolocation, category, description, and optional imagery to help
          bring these places to life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond personal exploration, the app also includes social features ‚Äî like, comment, and view placemarks
          created by other users. An admin panel provides moderation tools and overall system insights.
